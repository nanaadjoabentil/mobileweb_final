This project is to help users report incidents on roads: bad driving, sleep driving, car blocking the road, etcetera

It makes use of the camera for taking picutre or video evidence to back a post, and a GPS locator on phone to show where the user is
i.e. where the incident is happening

It is linked to authority organizations who can access the database, see current posts about incidents and act accordingly.
